let a=20;
console.log("a is "+a)
//let a=24;
 //throws error  because variable 'a' is declared twice without being initialized again

//Solution:
{
    let b = 10;
    console.log("b is",b);
}

const c=30;
//const c=40; //this will throw an error as we are trying
console.log("const c is" ,c)
 
var d=23
var d=25
console.log("var d is",d)
